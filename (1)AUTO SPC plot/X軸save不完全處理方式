One good option is to rotate the tick labels.

In your specific case, you might find it convenient to use figure.autofmt_xdate() (Which will rotate the x-axis labels among other things).

Alternatively, you could do plt.setp(plt.xticks()[1], rotation=30) (or various other ways of doing the same thing).

Also, as a several year later edit, with recent versions of matplotlib, you can call fig.tight_layout() to resize things to fit the labels inside the figure, as @elgehelge notes below.

plt.tight_layout()
But be sure to add this command after plt.plot() or plt.bar()

Setting the bounding box when saving will also show the labels:

figure.savefig('myplot.png', bbox_inches='tight')
